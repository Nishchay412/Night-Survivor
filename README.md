# Night-Survivor
In "NIGHT SURVIVOR," you find yourself in a world plunged into darkness, where the sun has set for an indefinite period, and survival is the only goal. Set in a desolate and eerie environment, this game challenges players to endure the perils of an endless night filled with unpredictable and menacing threats. As the player, you must navigate through a dynamically changing landscape while evading hordes of undead creatures, using your agility, strategy, and wits to survive until dawn – if it ever comes.

Gameplay Overview:

Survive the Night: As the protagonist, you are thrust into a hostile environment where the dead walk, and the shadows themselves seem to conspire against you. The primary objective is simple: survive. But surviving is easier said than done. Every night brings new threats, and the enemies are relentless, always appearing in unexpected places, keeping you on your toes.

Unique Mechanics: "NIGHT SURVIVOR" is not just a test of reflexes but also a test of strategy. You have access to several unique abilities that you must use wisely to evade or confront the undead:

Jumping: Leap over obstacles and enemies, navigating terrain with agility to avoid getting cornered.
Crawling: Slip through tight spaces or under barriers, evading detection and attacks.
Teleportation: Instantly relocate to a different part of the map, providing a quick escape from imminent danger or allowing you to reach advantageous positions.
Dynamic Enemy Behavior: The zombies are unpredictable, appearing at random positions across the map. They don’t just lumber aimlessly; some move faster, others group together, creating waves of attacks. The AI of these enemies adapts to your strategies, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same. This randomness forces players to stay alert, think quickly, and adapt on the fly.

Environmental Challenges: The landscape is filled with obstacles, traps, and areas that require different strategies to navigate. Whether it's a broken bridge, a dense forest, or a dilapidated building, every location provides unique challenges and opportunities for survival. Certain areas might offer temporary shelter but could quickly turn into a deathtrap if zombies swarm. Use the environment to your advantage by finding the best routes, utilizing cover, and discovering hidden items or power-ups.

Power-Ups and Weapons: Scattered throughout the map are various power-ups and weapons that can turn the tide in your favor. From limited-time speed boosts to makeshift weapons like a bat or a crowbar, these items are crucial for surviving the ever-increasing waves of enemies. Discover and use these strategically, but remember that resources are scarce, and using them wisely could mean the difference between life and death.

Day-Night Cycle and Time Pressure: Although the game is set in a seemingly endless night, time still progresses, and your actions during each segment of the night have consequences. The game features a day-night cycle where players can find temporary safety during the dawn but must be prepared for even fiercer and more numerous zombies when the night returns. Make use of every second of twilight to prepare for the next cycle of darknes
